# Hey!! Nice to See You  
Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm Ziran Fuzooly, Senior Software Engineer from Sri Lanka.

# About Me!  
As a software engineer with extensive experience in both front-end and back-end development, I have had the privilege of working with some of the most innovative companies in the industry. I am excited to share my resume and professional experience with you on LinkedIn.

Currently, I am working as a Senior Software Engineer at Softvil Technologies, deputed to Grubtech as a consultant. In this role, I focus on delivering robust software solutions and enhancing system efficiency through full-stack development. Prior to this, I worked at Circles.Life, where I contributed to developing a SaaS-based "Digital Telco as a Service" platform used by global telcos. My primary focus there was front-end development, where I worked on new features and enhanced existing ones.

Before joining Circles.Life, I worked as a front-end engineer at Motion Miracles, a gaming company behind some of the most popular games on the market. My main project at Motion Miracles was a dashboard application, where I was involved in front-end development, UI/UX design, database management, and testing. The technologies I used for this project include ReactJS, Bootstrap, and Firebase.

Beyond my professional work, I am passionate about mentoring and supporting the next generation of software engineers. I currently serve as a mentor for Future Ready Mentoring at Westminster, helping mentees refine their CVs, cover letters, applications, and LinkedIn profiles, while also providing emotional and career guidance.

In terms of technical skills, I am proficient in React.js, Next.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, front-end development, web design, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), WiX, Bootstrap, Blender, and UI/UX. I am constantly expanding my knowledge and staying updated on the latest industry trends and technologies.

My passion for software engineering, combined with my experience and skills, make me a valuable asset to any team. I look forward to connecting with professionals in the industry on LinkedIn and exploring new opportunities.
